# Belly Button Bacteria Data & Visualization
### Module 12

Used JavaScript to analyze a JSON file about a study done on participant's belly button bacteria levels.

Used Plotly to visualize the data in bar chart, bubble chart, and gauge format.

Used HTML to present the data and visualizations in an accesssible format.

I needed to create a new repository because the old one would only pull the "github pages" information from earlier on in the module when we plotted the information about the Greek gods.
